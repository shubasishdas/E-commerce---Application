- When updating state on event handling(onClick) and trying to get updated state in that same event handling, itâ€™s tricky to get that. SetState acts here as asynchronmous due to batch updating.
    <button onClick={()=> { 
                        this.setState(
                            () => {
                                return {
                                    name:"minju"
                                };							
                            },
                            () => {
                                    console.log(this.state);
                            }
                        );
    }}
    > change name
    </button>
