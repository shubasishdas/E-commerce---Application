- constructor() method automatically runs when class component is called. 
    We can initiate state and variable in constructor method. super() method calls the extended component.
- ReactDOM changes when then the reference of state object changes; not the value of object changes. 
    So when we change the state value on an event handling, like `this.state.name=”minju”` it won’t changes the dom. Rather we had to user `this.setState({name:”minju”})`
