- Functional components are different from class components that are not having constructor, render , lifecycle methods rather they are going to have javascript shaped functional structure whose are returning jsx.
- Functional components are going to follow impure functions as they are having side effects by using different hooks.
- Pure functions are those whose return solely depend on the parameter passing on function.
- Impure functions are those whose are relying on parameter out of that functional scope.


# pure function
			funcA(a,b){
				return a+b;
			}

# impure function
	    c = 5;
			funcB(a,b){
				return a+b+c;
			}		

			# with side effects
			-> side effect is when the function creates some kind of effect
				 outside of scope even the returning of function may not change.
 
			c = 5;
			funcB(a,b){
				c = a*b;
				return a+b;
			}
