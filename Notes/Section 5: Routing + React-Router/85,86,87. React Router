- When importing any svg and using as a component, we need to import as below
    import { ReactComponent as CrwnLogo } from "../../assets/crown.svg";

    <CrwnLogo />

- We can use **Link** tag from react-router-dom to direct into an url when click on something.
    <Link className="logo-container" to="/">
        <CrwnLogo className="logo" />
    </Link>

- When **div**  is not required specially for wrap up after returning from function, we can use there fragments **<> /<>**
- To remove the underline from a link, use **text-decoration:none**
- If we want width/height doesnâ€™t change with padding, we can imply **box-sizing:border-box**
