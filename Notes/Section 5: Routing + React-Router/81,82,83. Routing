- Routing is navigating to different web pages in an application. For routing we can use react-router or reach-router. In our app, we will use react-router.
- **BrowserRouter** is the component to store the info where the page is navigated to a url. We should wrap the whole app within this component.
- **Routes** component leverages the application to use **Route** component.
- **Route** component renders the element in a specific path.

# index.js
		<React.StrictMode>
		    <BrowserRouter>
		      <App />
		    </BrowserRouter>
		 </React.StrictMode>
	
# App.js
			<Routes>
	      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
	    </Routes>
